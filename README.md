# Overview
Under the mentorship of esteemed researchers Yusu Wang and Gal Mishne from the Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego, our project delves into the intricate world of graph representations within highway networks, exploring new techniques for traffic speed prediction. Through the process of constructing diverse graphs, integrating a variety of node features and edge types, we aim to explore new ways to represent the dynamics of highway traffic networks. We then utilize a Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (ST-GAT), training it on these graphs and predicting traffic speed over the enxt 15, 30, and 45 minutes from a given time period.

A description of each graph is provided below. Feel free to take a look at our results using the Google Colab link provided for each respective graph!
